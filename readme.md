# RepCounter

This fully-functional project connects to a downward-facing [Intel RealSense
depth
camera](https://store.intelrealsense.com/buy-intel-realsense-depth-camera-d415.html)
for continuous monitoring, and the automatic detection, counting, and logging of
any pushups that occur beneath it. By tweaking a few constants, it is able to
accurately count many different exercises, but it is not yet able to distinguish
between them.

I made Rep Counter as part of a real-time systems course at UIUC, where I was
allowed free-reign when choosing what to make for the 40 hour project required
as part of the course. The best explanation of how RepCounter works is the
presentation I made on it at the end of the semester, which can be found at this
